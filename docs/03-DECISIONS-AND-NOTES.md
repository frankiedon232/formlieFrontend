# 03 — Decisions, Interpretations and Items to Confirm

Edit this file whenever a decision changes.

## Interpretations made from the brief

1. **"CEO on shared links"** is read as **SEO** (meta title, description, Open Graph image, canonical, noindex toggle).
2. **"Role level security"** in the backend brief is read as **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)**. Role-based access (RBAC) is a separate, later feature.
3. **Tenant vs organisation:** tenant = subscribing account + subdomain; organisation = unit inside the tenant. Both IDs on every tenant table.
4. **Re-editing a published form:** creates a new draft version; the published version **stays live** until the draft is published. Option to "unpublish while editing" if the owner wants the form offline.
5. **"Same token should not be sent twice":** every issued token is unique (Fernet random IV + timestamp); refresh tokens are single-use and rotated; per-request replay is blocked by the envelope nonce. The access token itself is reused across requests until its 15-min expiry — making every access token single-use would force a round trip per request.
6. **"Microservice architecture":** modular monolith API + independent Celery worker services over RabbitMQ events, designed so modules can be split out later.
7. **"No reinventing CSS":** use Nuxt UI components, their `ui`/`class` props and Tailwind utilities only. The one exception is user-designed form themes, applied through CSS variables on the rendered form.
8. **Drag and drop:** Nuxt UI has no DnD primitive, so we use `vue-draggable-plus` (SortableJS) — the only extra UI dependency — with keyboard alternatives.
9. **Live collaboration:** planned as an optional later phase (Yjs CRDT over WebSockets) once the single-user builder is stable.

## Corrections to the dev setup

- Hosts use `formalie.dev` → switch to `*.formalie.dev` (see 02-DEV-ENVIRONMENT.md).
- mkcert cert must include `*.formalie.dev`.
- Venv named `fmly` but activated as `fmly` → standardise.

## To confirm

- Production domains: `formalie.com` (website), `manage.formalie.com`, `forms.formalie.com`, `api.formalie.dev`, `*.formalie.com`, short-link domain? Check domain and trademark availability for "Formalie" — several products use that name.
- Email provider for OTP/notifications (Amazon SES, Postmark, Resend, Mailgun) and SMS provider.
- Hosting target (VPS/Kubernetes/cloud) and object storage provider.
- GeoIP: MaxMind GeoLite2 needs a free account and licence key.
- Payment providers for subscriptions (Paystack for NGN, Stripe for international).
- Data residency requirements for early customers.
